# Pipelined-Floating-Point-Multiplier-RTL-to-GDS-
Designed a Pipelined Floating Point Multiplier that works with IEEE 754 Single Precision FP numbers at RTL level , performed synthesis and verified functionality by Gate Level Simulation (GLS) then performed the backedn physical design from Floorplan to Signoff using Innovus.
